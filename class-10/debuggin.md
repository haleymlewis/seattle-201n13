Debugging Workflow:
* check browser console & resolve all error messages
  * look at file name, line number of error, and error type
* check for useful linter messages near the source of the error
* console log the value you are trying to work with
* note all of the places in your code that define or modify the value you are working with
* try commenting things out, then adding them back. work backward until you find the first source of error
* try calling functions or inspecting vars in console
  * is the value named correctly?
  * is the value defined?
  * is the value the right type?
  * does the object have the props/methods you expect?
  * does the function return the value(s) it should?
  * are you calling the function with the right number/type of arguments?
  * does the array have the number/type of elements you expect?
* inspect the HTML elements
  * do all the elements exist in the HTML?
  * is the HTML hierarchy correct?
  * does the element actually have an event listener attached?
  * does the element have all the attributes you expect?
  * have you mixed up a class & an ID?
